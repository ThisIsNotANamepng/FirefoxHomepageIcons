# FirefoxHomepageIcons

This is a simple repository for holding icons for the Firefox homepage

They replce the default generated icons for shortcuts on the home page

#### MOST OF THE ICONS ARE NOT MY ORIGINAL WORK, ALL I DID WAS RESIZE THEM INTO USABLE PNG FILES

#### All of the icons came from https://github.com/Donnnno/Arcticons, except for the Wadokai and Cryptpad logos, I modified them myself
